+                                                                                      +
+  b2 - system volume (here 1 cubic metre).                                            +
+                                                                                      +
+  c1, d - water case (c1, integer) and associated value (d, real). c1 = 1 means       +
+  that the relative humidity of the system is to be fixed to the value of d,          +
+  which in this example is 42% (specified as a fraction).                             +
+                                                                                      +
+  Alternative water options are case c1 = 2, in which case d must be the total        +
+  number of moles of water in the system. Here the program will solve for the         +
+  equilibrium distribution of water and will give the calculated RH as an output.     +
+  For c1 = 3, d is again the total number of moles of water in the system, but in     +
+  this case it is not allowed to partition into the vapour, and remains in the        +
+  condensed phase as a liquid, ice, or water of hydration.                            +
+                                                                                      +
+  c2  - this is the water dissociation option. A value of -1 means that               +
+  dissociation is not calculated for any input conditions. A value of zero means      +
+  that if both numbers of moles of H+  and OH- are zero on input, then H2O            +
+  dissociation will remain off, and neither ion will be a variable in the             +
+  calculations. If either H+ or OH- is present on input, then the other will be       +
+  made a variable and water dissociation will be on. A value of 1 means that          +
+  water dissociation will always be calculated, and both H+(aq) and OH-(aq)           +
+  will be made variables in the calculation, even if their input amounts are zero.    + 
+                                                                                      +
+  e-m - these values are, in order, the numbers of moles of                           +
+  H+, NH4+, Na+, SO4=, NO3-, Cl-, Br-, OH- and NH3 present (see above for valid       +
+  valid combinations of the species for the E-AIM different models).                  +
+                                                                                      +
+  n  -  this controls how gas phase HNO3 is treated by the program. A value           +
+  of '3' means that it is assumed not to occur, hence all NO3- (and associated H+)    +
+  remain in the condensed phase(s). A value of '4' means, again, assume no            +
+  formation of HNO3(g) but report its equilibrium partial pressure over the liquid    +
+  phase (if it exists, and also contains both H+ and NO3-). A value of '0' means      +
+  that HNO3(g) can be formed and will be partitioned between the phases if            +
+  the ions are present. No other values of n are permitted.                           +
+                                                                                      +
+  o  -  as n above, for the gas HCl.                                                  +
+                                                                                      +
+  p  -  as n above, for the gas NH3.                                                  +
+                                                                                      +
+  q  -  as n above, for the gas H2SO4.                                                +
+                                                                                      +
+  r  -  as n above, for the gas HBr.                                                  +
+                                                                                      +
+  s  -  the number of solids whose options are to be individually entered. In the     +
+  above example, s is zero, which means that the program will look for all the        +
+  possible solids that can form and include them in the equilibration.                +
+                                                                                      +
+    If s is equal to 1 or more, then it must be followed by the reference numbers     +
+  and associated option values (both integers) of the s solids to be treated          +
+  specially. For example, '1 10 3' instead of '0' would mean:                         +
+    * 1 solid phase                                                                   +
+    * reference number = 10 (i.e., (NH4)2SO4))                                        +
+    * option = 3 (means exclude from calculation).                                    +
+                                                                                      +
+  The only other available option value is '4', which means exclude from the          +
+  calculation but report the saturation ratio.                                        +
+                                                                                      +
+  Another example, '2  10 3  13 4' instead of '0' means:                              +
+    * 2 solids                                                                        +
+    * 1st solid reference number = 10 (i.e., (NH4)2SO4)                               +
+    * 1st solid option = 3 (means exclude from calculation).                          +
+    * 2nd solid reference number = 13 (i.e., NH4NO3)                                  +
+    * 2nd solid option = 4 (means exclude from calculation)                           +

+                                                                                      +
+  0 - allow the gas/solid/mixed solid to form, the dissociation (of                   +           
+      organic acid or base) to occur, or the liquid/liquid equilibrium                +
+      to be calculted if the appropriate quantities have been set in the              +
+      eaim.org file. For example, if a value of the vapour pressure or Henry's        +
+      law constant has been specified then if the option value is 0                   +
+      the compound will be allowed to partition into the gas phase.                   +
+      If the thermodynamic quantity has *not* been specified then the                 +
+      option value will have no effect, and can safely be left at zero.               +
+      In the case of dissociation, of an organic acid or base, a value of             +
+      0 means that the program will calculate the equilibrium.                        +
+                                                                                      +
+  3 - prevent (switch off) gas/solid/mixed solid/dissociation, or a                   +
+      liquid/liquid equilibration, from occuring. So, to use the above                +
+      examples, a value of 3 for the gas option of the organic prevents it            +
+      partitioning into the gas phase even if the compound has been assigned a        +
+      Henry's law constant or vapour pressure. For liquid/liquid equilibrium this     +
+      option constrains any compound that would otherwise be able to partition        +
+      between both liquid phases to exist *only* in the aqueous phase.                +

+  4 - this option value has the same effect as a value of 3, but the equilibrium      +
+      vapour pressure or solid saturation ratio will be calculated                    +
+      and included in the output.                                                     +

+  (that have been neutralised to aminium ions by H+) and the three inorganic anions.  +
+  (Of course the user must also have entered the appropriate equilibrium constants    +
+  in eaim.org.) The options for all three salts are represented by a single integer   +
+  as follows. The option value itself is the sum of the following codes:              +
+                                                                                      +
+     1 - switch off formation of aminium sulphate salt                                +
+     2 - switch off formation of aminium nitrate salt                                 +
+     4 - switch off formation of aminium chloride salt                                +

+  be switched off then the option value will be 1 + 4 = 5. If only the chloride       +
+  salt is to be switched off then the value of the option is 4. If all salts are      +
+  to be allowed to form then the option value is 0 (zero). This value (i.e., 0)       +
+  shoudl also be used when the organic is not an amine and this option is therefore   +
+  irrelevent.                                                                         +

+  a system containing 2 organics (1.0 mole of the first, and 2.5 moles of the         +
+  second). The first organic is an amine (and can form solid sulphate, nitrate, and   +
+  chloride salts). Partitioning of the first organic into the gas phase is switched   +
+  off, as is the aqueous phase dissociation of the second. The formation of the       +
+  aminium nitrate salt (for the first organic only) is switched off:                  +

+  The line of input below specifies a chemical system containing 0.1 mol m-3 of       +
+  H2SO4, 0.15 mol m-3 of (NH4)2SO4, and three organic compounds for which the amounts +
+  are 0.05 0.075 and 0.9 mol m-3. The thermodynamic properties of the three organic   +
+  compounds must be specified in file eaim.org, and the details of how to do this are +
+  described in the header of that text file.                                          +

+  In this system we fix the RH at 0.55 (55%), and prevent the partitioning of H2SO4   +
+  from the condensed phase into the gas phase. We also switch off the formation of    +
+  the solid salt NH4HSO4(s). The second organic compound is an acid, which            +
+  dissociates in the aqueous phase, and in this calculation we prevent the            +
+  dissociation from occurring (ie, we switch it off). Finally, for this example, the  +
+  third organic compound is an amine and the formation of aminium sulphate salt is    +
+  also switched off.                                                                  +
